<p>One day Tsuruku Tazaki's four closest friends, the friends he'd known for a long time, announced that they did not want to see him, or talk with him, ever again. It was a sudden, decisive declaration, with no room for compromise. They gave no explanation, not a word, for this harsh pronouncement.</p>
<p>This drastic change took place during summer vacation of his sophomore year, between the first and second semesters. Afterward Tsuruku Tazaki's life was changed forever, as if a sheer ridge had divided the original vegetation into two distinct biomes.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, but I have to ask you not to call any of us anymore,” Ao said abruptly and without preface. No “Hey!” or “How’ve you been?” or “It’s been a while.” I’m sorry was his only concession to social niceties.</p>
<p>Tsukuru took a breath, and silently repeated Ao’s words, quickly assessing them. He tried to read the emotions behind them, but the words were like the formal recitation of an announcement. There had been no room for feelings.</p>
<p>“If everybody’s telling me not to call them, then of course I won’t,” Tsukuru replied. The words slipped out, almost automatically. He had tried to speak normally, calmly, but his voice sounded like a stranger’s. The voice of someone living in a distant town, someone he had never met (and probably never would).</p>
<p>“Then don’t,” Ao said.</p>
<p>“I don’t plan on doing anything people don’t want me to do,” Tsukuru said.</p>
<p>Ao let out a sound, neither a sigh nor a groan of agreement.</p>
<p>“But if possible, I do want to know the reason for this,” Tsukuru said.</p>
<p>“That’s not something I can tell you,” Ao replied. “Then who can?”</p>
<p>A thick stone wall rose. There was silence on the other end. Tsukuru could faintly hear Ao breathing through his nostrils. He pictured Ao’s flat, fleshy nose.</p>
<p>“Think about it, and you’ll figure it out,” Ao said, finally.</p>
<p>Tsukuru was speechless. What was he talking about? Think about it? Think about what? If I think any harder about anything, I won’t know who I am anymore.</p>
<p>“It’s too bad it turned out like this,” Ao said. “All of you feel this way?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Everyone feels it’s too bad.”</p>
<p>“Tell me—what happened?” Tsukuru asked. “You’d better ask yourself that,” Ao said. Tsukuru detected a quaver of sadness and anger in his voice, but it was just for an instant. Before Tsukuru could think of how to respond, Ao had hung up.</p>
